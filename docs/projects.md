### Loan Default Prediction â€” Python, Scikit-learn, Jupyter, Excel | Dec 2024

- Built interpretable classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) to predict loan defaults, using model coefficients and feature importances to explain drivers.
- Addressed class imbalance with SMOTE and stratified k-fold cross-validation; achieved 90% precision on defaults and reduced false positives by 20% vs. baseline.
- Engineered domain features (debt-to-income ratio, credit-history length, repayment-behavior aggregates) to improve predictive power.
- Documented an end-to-end, reproducible workflow (feature selection, training, evaluation) in Jupyter; delivered Excel-ready evaluation reports.
